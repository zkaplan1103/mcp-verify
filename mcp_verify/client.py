`LLMClient` is the seam the agents talk to. Tests pass a fake implementation, so
no live Anthropic calls happen during the build / free test suite. The real
`AnthropicLLMClient` is constructed only from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the
environment at runtime — the key is never hardcoded, logged, or surfaced.
