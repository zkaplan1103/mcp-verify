"""Score the Verify agent against labeled cases.

Per case, every sentence is either planted (should be flagged) or grounded (should
not be). We match Verify's flagged claims to planted sentences by tag keyword, then
roll up to a confusion matrix and precision / recall / F1.

  FN: a planted sentence Verify missed (a hallucination slipped through — the
      costly error for this product)
  FP: a flag that doesn't correspond to any planted sentence (Verify cried wolf
