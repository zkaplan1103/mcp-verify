"""LLM-judge matcher for the eval harness.

The token matcher (eval/scorer.py) matches on surface form, so it can miscount
when Verify catches a claim in different words, or when a vague flag shares
tokens by coincidence. This judge asks a model the actual question — "does this
flag refer to this specific claim?" — to score on meaning instead.

Used only via `python -m eval.run --judge`; the token matcher stays the default
so CI and tests are free and deterministic.
