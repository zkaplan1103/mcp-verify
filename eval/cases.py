"""Labeled eval cases for the Verify agent.

A case is (profile, opportunity, draft, ground-truth labels). Each draft is built
from labeled sentences: some grounded in the profile/opportunity, some planted
(unsupported). The harness checks whether Verify flags the planted ones (recall)
without flagging the grounded ones (precision).

Matching predicted->planted is keyword-based (each planted claim carries a unique
`tag` keyword that appears verbatim in its sentence). This is deterministic and
needs no judge model; an LLM judge can be layered on later if string overlap
proves too blunt.
