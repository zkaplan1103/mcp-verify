"""Hand-written adversarial eval cases — the hardest cases for a verifier.

Each case is designed to exploit a specific weakness in hallucination detection:
partial truths, buried errors, precision traps, negation flips, close-but-wrong
numbers, and dense context that obscures a single fabricated detail.

These are FROZEN ground truth — edit only after human review.
